# Winston's Discord Stuff - Information
You've stumbled across what this organization is for, if it weren't already obvious.

## Purposes
This organization exists for the purpose of hosting my Discord modded-client-related repositories, clients such as Vizality or Powercord will be supported here (the later (Powercord) will receive less support moving into it's "V3" stage). I will also host other Discord related things here, such as code for my own Bot(s), however they will remain private for the time being.

Things such as...

* Plugins (for client mods)
* Themes (for client mods)
* Bots (for the Discord platform)

... will be hosted here, as aforementioned.

## Licensing
Licenses are repository-specific, this organisation does not apply one (1) license to all repositories held within.

If something is unlicensed or the license depicts that you must have express permission before using any of the source in your own projects, you must contact me beforehand. You can do this by reaching out to me on the *Powercord* Discord server or the *Vizality* Discord server by ping, I will not answer unsolicited DMs.

## Topics - What do they mean?
Topics are a way of sorting through my repositories, if you don't wish to see discontinued plugins you can just simply sift out "end-of-life" as a topic.

* end-of-life - The repository is no longer maintained, however if it breaks or does not behave as expected and someone submits a PR to fix it or attempt to fix it, I will check that it not only works, but performs expectedly. If it meets these two criteria, it is likely to be merged.
* \*-theme - It is a theme, for modded-clients.
* \*-plugin - It is a plugin, for modded-clients.

## Misuse - Punishments
Misusing the ability to comment or contribute to repositories through PRs or Issues etc. will result in a ban from the organization with no appeal. If I choose to lift your ban, it is my own decision, not because you begged me consistantly for a month.
